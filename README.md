# hodr-item-tracker
A visually pleasing little display one can use to keep track of the progression items they've picked up while playing a Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance randomizer.

Written in HTML, CSS, and JS (with jQuery). Feel free to add the GitHub Pages release as a browser source on your stream/recording setup!

Left-click an item's icon to mark it as found, and left-click again to remove it. Left-clicking the Hint Card (or the counter next to it) will increment the counter by 1, and right-clicking will decrement the counter by 1.
